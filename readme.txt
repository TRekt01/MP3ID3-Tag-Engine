This little Webapplication was build because i had to clean up my ID3-Tags for my music-library. Im a DJ using Traktor-Scratch-Pro and good ID3-Tags are essential. So this Application is using "crawlers" to search the ID3-Tags online. I developed a crawler for "Beatport-Pro" to search the Tags / Covers there. Thats all i needed because for Techno, you will find everything there! If you want, you can write a new Crawler - there are interfaces and abstract classes that you can use for that. 

All you need to do is:

1) Create a Library-Folder and put the ZF-Library in there
2) You also have to put "Getid3" in this library folder
3) Run a Webserver, point to mp3writer/html/index.php
4) Go to mp3writer/application/configs/application.ini and set you mp3 directory
5) run

No support or shit like that, im almost exclusively coding for my work so i dont have much time for support/maintanance.


Big probs to zend framework, guys ur the best ur shit makes my life so much easier!

Also probs to "GetID3", nice work and ty for sharing ur library!
